Scripts Used
==============

Before I was used a personnal script to generate framework files. But when I have decide to update my project, I have see there is already good script available. So it's why I use scripts files from: https://github.com/jverkoey/iOS-Framework. Don't forget, script files are in Apache 2.0 License
